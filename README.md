NeuralSolver is an open-source library for deep learning researchers, especially for neural PDE solvers.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2025.10) We propose [FlashBias (NeurIPS 2025)](https://github.com/thuml/FlashBias) to support fast computation of scientific models. With FlashBias, it is easy to introduce a learnable spatial distance bias into the Transformer for better geometry learning. Check the [Transformer_Spatial_Bias](https://github.com/thuml/Neural-Solver-Library/blob/main/models/Transformer_Spatial_Bias.py) model for details. Welcome to try FlashBias and implement your own scientific bias.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2025.03) We release the NeuralSolver as a simple and neat code base for benchmarking neural PDE solvers, which is extended from our previous GitHub repository [Transolver](https://github.com/thuml/Transolver).

## Features

This library currently supports the following benchmarks:

- Six Standard Benchmarks from [[FNO]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895) and [[geo-FNO]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05209)
- PDEBench [[NeurIPS 2022 Track Datasets and Benchmarks]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07182) for benchmarking autoregressive tasks
- ShapeNet-Car from [[TOG 2018]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3197517.3201325) for benchmarking industrial design tasks

🌟 We have made a great effort to ensure good reproducibility, and are glad to claim that the official results of all the above methods can be completely reproduced (sometimes even better) by this library. 

## Usage

1. Install Python 3.8. For convenience, execute the following command.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare Data. You can obtain the data from our previous repository [here](https://github.com/thuml/Transolver).
3. Train and evaluate the model. We provide the experiment scripts for all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as follows:

```bash
bash ./scripts/StandardBench/airfoil/Transolver.sh
```

4. Develop your own model.

- Add the model file to the folder `./models`. You can follow the `./models/Transolver.py`.
- Include the newly added model in the `model_dict` of `./models/model_factory.py`.
- Create the corresponding scripts under the folder `./scripts`, where you can set hyperparameters following the provided scripts of other models.
